    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This pre-class material introduces the fundamental concepts of data visualization using Altair, focusing on scatter charts and bar charts. You'll learn about the grammar of graphics, data types, encoding channels, and basic chart creation that will prepare you for the in-class lecture and assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Required:** 90 minutes  \n",
    "**Prerequisites:** Basic Python and pandas knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand the grammar of graphics: data, marks, and encoding channels\n",
    "- Identify and work with different data types (nominal, ordinal, quantitative, temporal)\n",
    "- Create basic scatter plots and bar charts using Altair\n",
    "- Apply individual encoding channels (position, color, size, shape) to visualize data\n",
    "- Distinguish between different bar chart types\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is Altair?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python. By *declarative*, we mean that you can provide a high-level specification of **what** you want the visualization to include, in terms of **data**, **graphical marks**, and **encoding channels**, rather than having to specify **how** to implement the visualization in terms of for-loops, low-level drawing commands, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is that you **specify associations** between **data fields** and **visual encoding channels**, such as the x-axis, y-axis, color, etc. The rest of the plot details are handled automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup and Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be visualizing global health and population data for a number of countries, over the time period of 1955 to 2005. The data was collected by the [Gapminder Foundation](https://www.gapminder.org/) and shared in [Hans Rosling's popular TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w). If you haven't seen the talk, we encourage you to watch it first!"

    "- `y`: Vertical (y-axis) position of the mark.\n",

    "- `color`: Mark color, specified as a [legal CSS color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value).\n",
    "- `opacity`: Mark opacity, ranging from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).\n",
    "- `shape`: Plotting symbol shape for `point` marks.\n",
